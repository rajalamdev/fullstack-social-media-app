This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the command:
```yarn add yarn```

Second, Install all required packages:
```
yarn add nookies javascript-time-ago @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons 
@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@latest react-loading-skeleton
```


Last, run the development server:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Note: You must have Strapi Backend
